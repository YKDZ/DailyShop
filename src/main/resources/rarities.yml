# If there are 10 products in a shop,
# 6 of them has common rarity whose weight is 100;
# 3 of them has uncommon rarity whose weight is 80;
# The remaining one has ancient rarity with weight 20.
# Then, you can get a total weight: 6 * 100 + 3 * 80 + 1 * 20 = 860.
# So, the chance of the shop to list a common product is:
# 6 * 100 / total weight * 100% = 69.7%.
# Simply put, the higher the weight of a certain product and
# the more products under its rarity, the easier it is to be listed.
